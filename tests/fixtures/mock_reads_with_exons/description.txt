This folder tests exon-to-read alignment.

There are 3 exons in exons.fasta and 7 reads in reads.fastq. The metadata line
in the fastq file describes what exons and other sequences are in each read.

For example: exon1[1-to-14][Q61,91,57] means there is exon1 from position 1
to position 14, with repeat bases whose first quality scores are 61, 91 and
57.

minQXX refers to the minimum quality score used to randomly generate the
quality scores for each read.
